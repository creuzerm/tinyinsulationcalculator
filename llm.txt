# Tiny Home Heat Loss & Passive Performance Calculator

## Description
This web application is a tool for estimating the heating load and passive thermal performance of small structures like tiny homes, sheds, and cabins. It features heat loss calculation using the UA method, A/B scenario testing, a thermal battery calculator, and passive temperature simulation.

## Key Files
- index.html: Main application for the heat loss calculator.
- existing_building_estimator.html: Tool for estimating R-values of existing buildings.
- calculator.js: Core logic for the main calculator.
- README.md: Detailed documentation of methodologies and usage.

## Methodologies
- **Heat Loss (UA Method):** Calculates envelope and floor loss.
- **Thermal Mass:** Estimates thermal inertia of floor systems (concrete, earth, wood).
- **Passive Simulation:** Simulates temperature drift over time considering internal and solar gains.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` to use the main calculator.
- Open `existing_building_estimator.html` for R-value estimation.
- Supports "A/B Comparison" to test different construction scenarios.
- Inputs are persisted in local storage.
